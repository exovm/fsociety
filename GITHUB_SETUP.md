# GitHub Setup Instructions

## What's Safe to Push

The following files are included and SAFE for GitHub:
- `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `We_See_You.py` - Main fsociety terminal script
- `build_exe.bat` - Build script for executable
- `extended_commands.py` - Additional command implementations
- `RUN_ME.bat` - Quick run script

## What's Protected (NOT pushed to GitHub)

The `.gitignore` file automatically excludes:
- `.claude/` directory and any Claude-related files
- `settings.local.json` - Local Claude settings
- `fsociety_logs/` - Session logs and personal data
- `build/` and `dist/` folders - Build artifacts
- Any files with `*api*`, `*key*`, `*token*`, `*secret*` in name
- `.env` files and configuration files

## How to Push to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (don't initialize with README)

2. Add the remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

3. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository is Ready!

Your local git repository is configured and ready to push. All sensitive files are protected by the comprehensive `.gitignore` file.

## Safety Features

- All Claude/AI related files are excluded
- Personal logs and session data protected
- Build artifacts excluded to keep repo clean
- Local configuration files ignored
- API keys and tokens automatically excluded

The repository contains only the core fsociety terminal code and documentation.
